        <h2><em>Biography</em></h2>
        <p>Salvador Dal&iacute; is a famous surrealist artist. He is known not only for his remarkable artwork, but also for his eccentric lifestyle and personality.
        <br><br>Dal&iacute; was born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain in 1904, shortly after the death of his older brother, also named Salvador. When he was five years old, Dal&iacute;'s parents told him that he was the reincarnation of his dead brother. This stayed with Dal&iacute; and influenced some of his works, most famously in <em>Portrait of My Dead Brother</em>.
        <br><br>Dal&iacute; attended art school in Spain, where his art flourished, despite his lack of academic discipline. In 1919, Dal&iacute; had his first public exhibition in his home town. Subsequently, he began to experiment with cubism and Dadaism. In 1926, Dal&iacute; was introduced to surrealism, and he began to weave modern and avant-garde styles into his works, creating a style of his own. During this time, Dal&iacute; established himself as an up-and-coming artist with exhibitions in Barcelona.
        <br><br>In 1929, Dal&iacute; took up the company of the surrealists, who enjoyed his work. Dal&iacute; met his wife and muse, Gala, a Russian immigrant who was much older than Dal&iacute; and married to another man at the time of their introduction. Despite pushbacks from friends, family, and the Church, Dal&iacute; and Gala married, and she became his business manager. Dal&iacute; was becoming a very popular figure, and his 1931 painting <em>The Persistence of Memory</em>, perhaps his most famous painting, solidified his place in the public eye.
        <br><br>Dal&iacute; is known not only for his surrealist artwork, but his surrealist costumes and performances. He once attended an event wearing a glass-encased bra on his chest. He gave a lecture wearing a deep-sea diving suit and helmet (which had to be removed for him to speak) with two Russian wolfhounds in tow and a pool cue in hand. Dal&iacute; also had a menagerie of exotic pets, which he made some public appearances with, including an ocelot and an anteater. Dal&iacute;'s persistently bizarre behavior combined with his brilliant work landed him the cover of <em>Time</em> magazine in 1936.
        <br><br>Dal&iacute; incorporated many themes and concepts in his art, including the natural sciences, geometry, religion, nuclear physics, pointillism, unique perscpectives, and atomic weapons. Dal&iacute; was more than a painter; he created many other works, including jewelry, sculptures, performance art, books, clothes, stage sets, short films, store display windows, and furniture. One of these is <em>Destino</em>, a short film created in collaboration with Walt Disney which was not finished until after Dal&iacute;'s death.
        <br><br>Salvador Dal&iacute; died of heart failure in 1988 at the age of 84 in his home town of Figueres.
        <br><br>Dal&iacute;'s public works can be seen in the following places, among others:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salvador Dal&iacute; Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, United States</li>
            <li>Teatro Museo Dal&iacute; in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain</li>
            <li>Caesarea Ralli Museum in Caesarea, Israel</li>
