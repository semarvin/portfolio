          <em>Introduction:</em> In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a popular tool for creatives. Scholars, artists, writers, museums, researchers, and others have begun to explore the potential for AI outside of its STEM and business applications. AI has been used to create images, music, animations, websites, poems, films, novels, and more. In terms of text generation, the main focus of this paper, AI has been used to write articles for The New Yorker and other major publications; write, star in, and direct short films; generate novellength texts; and write cards for Cards Against Humanity—and that is but a sampling of AI’s uses in text generation. <a href="https://thedali.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Machines_Certainly_Think_Marvin_formatted_final.pdf">Click here to read more.</a></p>

            <em>Introduction:</em> Instant cameras are a great dose of nostalgia. Each photograph is unique and nearly impossible to recreate. The Fujifilm Instax Wide 300 prints beautiful, vivid colors on extra wide film, allowing photographers to fit as much into the frame as possible. Wide film is best for landscapes, making it perfect for hikers, joggers, campers, and every kind of adventurer.<a href="https://activecities.com/blog/this-instant-camera-is-perfect-for-adventure-photographers/">Click here to read more.</a></p>

            <em>Introduction:</em> The opening of the animated short film <em>Destino</em> (2003) declares, in both English and French, “In 1946, two legendary artists began collaboration on a short film. More than half a century later, their creation has finally been completed.”1 The film, which was conceived by two legends of early 20th century art, Walt Disney and Salvador Dalí, has a tangled history. When work began on Destino, both artists were extremely well known. <a href="MarvinDestino.pdf">Click here to read more.</a></p>

            <em>Introduction:</em> The modern world has been fascinated by mummies and the rituals surrounding ancient Egyptian funerary practices since events like the discovery of Tutankhamun’s spectacular tomb in 1922 and Napoleon Bonaparte’s invasion of Egypt during the turn of the 19th century. While mummification has been practiced at various times in locations across the globe, the mummies of ancient Egypt have most captured public attention due to the highly ornate way in which some mummies were entombed and preserved. <a href="marvin_termessay.pdf">Click here to read more.</a></p>
