            <em>Process:</em> I recently redesigned my resume to better match my design portfolio and created a matching cover letter template. As you can see from my old resume above, this version incorporates the bold strip of color at the top and better aligns my logo so that it is not taking up as much space. I updated the heading font to match the font I use on this site, though I kept the uppercase letters on my resume for a more professional look. This rebrand updates the section headers to a more current design look and features the links for my portfolio, LinkedIn, and GitHub right at the top so that they are easy to find.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I made this invitation for a couple celebrating their engagement. They sent me pictures of their color scheme and flowers. Together, we determined a few design ideas and decided that the flowers should be featured in the invitation. Using a similar style to <a href="#concert">this concert illustration</a> which I completed in 2019, I hand drew each flower and leaf. I arranged them in opposite corners, with the upper corner more dominant. I added gold foil embellishments to really pull everything together. Finally, I added the typography. I selected a casual brush script because the party is not overly formal. It matches the style of both the party and the couple.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created this graduation announcement to send to my friend and family when I graduated from undergrad. I used a gradient to fake a gold foil look on the 'graduate' header and a clean, classic font for the rest to echo the font on the building behind me. I used bright, bold colors to tie the whole design together.<p>

          <p><em>Medium:</em> Adobe Photoshop<br><br>
          <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> I completed this digital invitation for a sponsorship weekend consisting of a lunch and a fashion show to promote an upcoming exhibit which featured fashion designs and wearable art. I was provided the graphic elements and copy. I made major changes to the layout and created the heading. I modeled the heading after the mastheads commonly featured in a lot of the collateral produced at The Dali. Here's an example of a masthead:
            <br><img src="images/masthead.png" width="40%" alt="A slash strikes through an image of The Dali Museum, cutting out the words 'step into the surreal' at an angle.">
            <br>I mirrored the style of the text while maintaining the design trends of the exhibit's accompanying materials. In the end, a more traditional header style was chosen. However, I stand behind this version because it pushes the boundaries of the new exhibit's design features while mirroring The Dali's design trends.</p>

          <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> The Dali Museum has an app which includes a list of all of the paintings in the Permanent Collection. However, sometimes some of those paintings aren't on view because they are either on loan to another museum or undergoing restoration, causing confusion and disappointment for some guests. To solve this problem, The Dali wanted to place icons over the paintings that weren't on view to indicate to visitors that these paintings were temporarily unavailable for viewing. The graphic design team created a plethora of options for both the "on loan" icon and the "restoration" icon. To the left is a mockup featuring some of the icons as they would appear on the app. The mockup was created in Photoshop and the icons were created in Illustrator. Below are some of the other icons that we produced. <br><br><img src="images/iconography2.png" width="70%" alt="This image shows more icons, including the ones listed above as well as some different versions of the portrait traveling the globe, the paintbrushes in a triangle, and people holding and moving portraits.

            <em>Process:</em> I created this banner for use on <a href="https://shop.thedali.org/">The Dali's online store</a>. It was used for the duration of the exhibit (about five months), but has since been changed out for a banner featuring the current exhibit's products. The banner was used to advertise discounted items. Many of the design elements were provided to me. I discussed the layout with many members of The Dali team. <a href="images/download.gif">This GIF</a> shows how the banner was displayed on the Museum's website.</p>

          <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> During a collateral overhaul and redesign, I created these two bookmark concept designs. These bookmarks would be given away to customers who made purchases in The Museum gift store. They are souvenirs so that people can fondly remember their time at The Dali, but also be encouraged to come back or make more purchases at the online store. These images show both the front and back of the bookmark. The back is the same on both. It provides information about membership benefits and advertises the online store. The first bookmark's front shows off a portion of Salvador Dali's 1960 painting <em>The Ecumenical Council</em>. This part of the painting shows a self-portrait of Dali painting a smaller canvas. The second bookmark has a very simple front which features only text. It quickly and easily conveys all the information a guest might need to contact or revisit the Museum.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I collaborated with several members of The Dali team to create this advertisement for a map of St. Petersburg. Together we chose which pictures to feature, which copy to include, which quotes to use, and how to arrange the layout. Although we debated the red background, we ultimately decided that the red was eye-catching and would stick out on a map with several other ads. Unfortunately, this ad was not printed until after my internship ended, so I only have its digital form.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created this mock poster for the 2013 film The Great Gatsby in the style of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drew+struzan+posters&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=974&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjaw_r54oHSAhVBlVQKHdJ_BPwQ_AUIBigB">Drew Struzan's movie posters from the '70s</a>. I used the same font and many graphic elements from the official posters, and combined stills of the main characters in a pyramid style. This poster went through several drafting phases before I settled on this look. Some of those drafts are below. Originally, I wanted to compile warm colored images to the left of the character portraits, and cool colored images to the right; however, this created a very cluttered layout. I decided to use just two pictures in the background — the fireworks and the eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg. Ultimately, I decided to keep the firework image below the movie's title and replace the eyes with the sleeker background from Gatsby's gate, creating an overall more cohesive image which was less overwhelming for the viewer.</p>

            <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> I made this logo to promote my personal brand. I use it for my graphic design portfolio, as well as <a href="https://semarvin.000webhostapp.com/index.html">my artwork</a>. The logo features an inverted triangle, a horizontal line, a script font, and a serif font. I had to edit the "s" in my name, as the original script had a highly stylized lowercase "s" that was hard to read. The triangle came from my original concept of using three eyes, a motif found in much of my artwork, which I later scrapped for the simpler triangle shape. My brainstorming process for this design can be seen below. I especially like this logo because the wording can be removed and it still conveys my brand. I use the copy-free version in small spaces, like my favicon for this site and on my resume. For this website, I created a gold variation of this logo, and a second gold variation which shimmers; this GIF can be seen at the bottom of every web page. I also made a scanning animation for the header of this website.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created this one-sheet as a prototype. It never made it past that phase while I was there, and I'm unsure if it was ever picked up after I left. It was created to be an easy handout which summarizes the information given in a ten-page impact report. I took all of the text from the original report, but placed my own emphasis on some key words. This one-sheet functions as a booklet which can be folded and read, then folded out completely as a mini-poster. We wanted to create a one-sheet which was economical and fully communicated all of the wonderful things accomplished at The Dali with the help of donors. I came up with the layout and most of the design on my own. I was handed the reigns on this project, and I really wish I had been able to stay long enough to see it come to fruition.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I was given this in-progress project to finish during my time at The Dali. I made extensive changes to the layout under the advice of <a href="https://www.juliahowarddesigns.com/">Julia Howard</a>, the Art Director at The Dali Museum. The treasure hunt went through several redesigns. It is currently available to any children (or adults!) at the audio tour desk at The Dali. It was challenging to make it available in nine different languages: Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. This presented unique challenges for the design. The version seen here was replaced shortly after it was printed, after I tweaked the design to better accommodate for the multiple languages to be used. The masthead, while it looks great, proved difficult to produce in nine different languages, so it was eventually changed into just a regular picture. A label for each language was placed just over the "riddle me this..." text, which was later adjusted. This treasure hunt was one of my biggest projects at The Dali. I was so excited and moved when I saw a young girl working on the treasure hunt while touring the Museum. </p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created these three inserts for a handful of table tents at The Museum's restaurant, Cafe Gala. The inserts advertise The Dali's new app, membership benefits, and The Dali's social media presence, respectively. I also created an insert to bring attention to The Dali's Sunday brunch. Initially, it was not used because the launch of the brunch was delayed, but it has since replaced the insert about the app. These table tents are still on view at The Dali. One of them made an appearance in a photo tweeted by the Dali Museum. I am also hidden in the photo on the social media insert—I'm the person in the middle!</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I designed <a href="http://semarvin.com/brutal/">this site</a> as a potential brutalist rebranding of my graphic design portfolio while finishing my Master's degree. I developed an interest in brutalist design and decided to try it on my own site, completely rewriting it to highlight: a color scheme which reflected early 2000s web culture; huge, in-your-face graphics and typography; and fun features, like draggable images, an extra large pointer trail, and skewed images. While this experiment proved to be a fun and useful test of my skills, I ultimately opted to stick with my current portfolio as it is easier to use and less aggressive on the eyes. In this case study, I included links to two different landing pages. I ended up using the first since it is simpler and more accessible, but the second option makes the brutalist theme more obvious and deserves to be shown off as well. I really like the white pixel edges on the animated logo; it feels very brutalist to me. </p>

            <em>Process:</em> I coded this site myself. It features a very minimalist design and big pictures. The homepage highlights some of my best graphic design work. It also features a responsive design. I redesigned the layout in 2020 to update it to modern design standards. I added the gold streak for interest, created an uneven grid design, and reduced the site to just four pages. I also added a black and white filter to all the images (which vanishes on hover) to make the color scheme more cohesive and create intrigue for users. Above, you can see various stages of the website.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> For a web design class, I created <a href="http://semarvin.com/dali/">this website</a> based around the life and works of Salvador Dali. I wrote about 90% of the HTML and CSS coding, while approximately 10% was provided by my instructor, including the Javascript scrolling effect. The site was coded with responsive design so that it can be viewed properly on mobile devices and tablets. This site has Bootstrap features and JavaScript functions.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created these floral canines for a project where I would create custom images based off a similar base. I drew sixteen different bases, over two hundred markings, more than twenty mutations (like horns, wings, etc.), and a handful of bespoke accessories like hoodies and necklaces. The image on the left shows only the uncolored base.

            <em>Process:</em> During the pandemic, I noticed a popular art style arising: semi-realistic portraits with some flat features. I decided to try my hand at this style and created this illustration of the singer Halsey. I decided to make their hair and eyebrows flat black shapes rather than adding dimension, though I rendered the rest of the illustration in full detail. I added a shadow to their hair and brows to offer a little bit of dimension, especially on the forehead area, but left it at that. The peach-colored background matches the blush on their cheeks.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I drew this illustration as a tattoo commission for a client who simply requested a geometric bison. He asked specifically for hexagons in the illustration. I presented him with the bison sketch shown below, and he showed me where he wanted the shapes to be placed. I moved forward with lining the piece and placing flat colors. I suggested to the client that a bigger circle up top may look better, and I added the Moon to the top of the piece. I added some shading and made some small adjustments to the geometry, as per the client's request.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I made this simple illustration, featuring semi-transparent wings, for a client who requested a fairy godmother. Below is my process. I began with my initial sketch. From there, I moved on to hard outlines, which I sent to the client for notes. The client requested some changes, mainly to make the godmother seem more youthful. However, the godmother then seemed too young for the client. We settled on a godmother who appeared to be in her 50s, so the final version of the illustration was created. It is very important to me to always deliver a product which the client is fully satisfied with.</p>
