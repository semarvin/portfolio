          <h5>engagement party invitation</h5>
            <p><em>Medium:</em> Adobe Photoshop and Wacom Tablet<br><br>
            <em>Year Created:</em> 2020<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> I made this invitation for a couple celebrating their engagement. They sent me pictures of their color scheme and flowers. Together, we determined a few design ideas and decided that the flowers should be featured in the invitation. Using a similar style to <a href="#concert">this concert illustration</a> which I completed in 2019, I hand drew each flower and leaf. I arranged them in opposite corners, with the upper corner more dominant. I added gold foil embellishments to really pull everything together. Finally, I added the typography. I selected a casual brush script because the party is not overly formal. It matches the style of both the party and the couple.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I do not consider myself to be a master of web design, but I can put together a cohesive, functioning site. I handwrote this very site myself. It features a very minimalist design and big pictures. The homepage highlights some of my best graphic design work. It also features a responsive design. I redesigned the layout in 2020 to update it to modern design standards. I added the gold streak for interest, created an uneven grid design, and reduced the site to just four pages. Above, you can see various stages of the website.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I wrote <a href="https://semarvin-art.netlify.app/">this very simple site</a> to showcase my digital artwork. It features a simple color scheme and big, bold, semi-transparent images with full opacity on hover. The design helps to minimize distractions from the art, which stands out especially well on the black background.</</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created this mock poster for the 2013 film The Great Gatsby in the style of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drew+struzan+posters&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=974&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjaw_r54oHSAhVBlVQKHdJ_BPwQ_AUIBigB">Drew Struzan's movie posters from the '70s</a>. I used the same font and many graphic elements from the official posters, and combined stills of the main characters in a pyramid style. This poster went through several drafting phases before I settled on this look. Some of those drafts are below. Originally, I wanted to compile warm colored images to the left of the character portraits, and cool colored images to the right; however, this created a very cluttered layout. I decided to use just two pictures in the background — the fireworks and the eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg. Ultimately, I decided to keep the firework image below the movie's title and replace the eyes with the sleeker background from Gatsby's gate, creating an overall more cohesive image which was less overwhelming for the viewer.</p>

We made up a fake concert headlined by an artist chosen by Florida State University students. I made this illustration as a header image for our <a href="https://lailayasmeenkhan.wixsite.com/fschoose">website</a> and our social media profiles: <a href="https://twitter.com/fschoose">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcVg6w_n5aF/?taken-by=fschoose">Instagram</a>, and <a href=" https://www.facebook.com/events/133762353927328/?active_tab=discussion">Facebook</a>. The image advertises a few of the choices which students are able to vote for in several online polls. I created the vector-style look in Photoshop by hand drawing each figure.<p>

            <em>Process:</em> For my 21st birthday party, I made and launched this Snapchat filter. It was placed at the bottom of the screen with no other decorations.

            <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> I made this logo to promote my personal brand. I use it for my graphic design portfolio, as well as <a href="https://semarvin.000webhostapp.com/index.html">my artwork</a>. The logo features an inverted triangle, a horizontal line, a script font, and a serif font. I had to edit the "s" in my name, as the original script had a highly stylized lowercase "s" that was hard to read. The triangle came from my original concept of using three eyes, a motif found in much of my artwork, which I later scrapped for the simpler triangle shape. My brainstorming process for this design can be seen below. I especially like this logo because the wording can be removed and it still conveys my brand. I use the copy-free version in small spaces, like my favicon for this site and on my resume. For this website, I created a gold variation of this logo, and a second gold variation which shimmers; this GIF can be seen at the bottom of every web page. I also made a scanning animation for the header of this website.</p>

            <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> For a web design class, I created <a href="daliv1/index.html">this website</a> based around the life and works of Salvador Dali. I wrote about 90% of the HTML and CSS coding, while approximately 10% was provided by my instructor, including the Javascript scrolling effect. The site was coded with responsive design so that it can be viewed properly on mobile devices and tablets. A version of the site made using Bootstrap and redesigned with more JavaScript features can be accessed <a href="daliv2/index.html">here</a>.</p>

            <em>Year Created:</em> 2016<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> I drew this illustration as a tattoo commission for a client who simply requested a geometric bison. He asked specifically for hexagons in the illustration. I presented him with the bison sketch shown below, and he showed me where he wanted the shapes to be placed. I moved forward with lining the piece and placing flat colors. I suggested to the client that a bigger circle up top may look better, and I added the Moon to the top of the piece. I added some shading and made some small adjustments to the geometry, as per the client's request.</p>

            <em>Year Created:</em> 2016<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> This tattoo was designed to resemble a galaxy in an artistic style (almost mininmalism, and not quite cartoon). The galaxy fits loosely in a triangle shape, with some stars peeking out.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I made this simple illustration, featuring semi-transparent wings, for a client who requested a fairy godmother. Below is my process. I began with my initial sketch. From there, I moved on to hard outlines, which I sent to the client for notes. The client requested some changes, mainly to make the godmother seem more youthful. However, the godmother then seemed too young for the client. We settled on a godmother who appeared to be in her 50s, so the final version of the illustration was created. It is very important to me to always deliver a product which the client is fully satisfied with.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created this logo for a client's shaved Hawaiian ice company. The client wanted something simple and sleek with a California skater feel and a wave somewhere in the logo. I made a wave vector to replace the A. For the colors, I used a tropical blue and a dark red, as requested by the client.</p>

          <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> I completed this digital invitation for a sponsorship weekend consisting of a lunch and a fashion show to promote an upcoming exhibit which featured fashion designs and wearable art. I was provided the graphic elements and copy. I made major changes to the layout and created the heading. I modeled the heading after the mastheads commonly featured in a lot of the collateral produced at The Dali. Here's an example of a masthead:
            <br><img src="images/masthead.png" width="40%">
            <br>I mirrored the style of the text while maintaining the design trends of the exhibit's accompanying materials. In the end, a more traditional header style was chosen. However, I stand behind this version because it pushes the boundaries of the new exhibit's design features while mirroring The Dali's design trends.</p>

          <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> The Dali Museum has an app which includes a list of all of the paintings in the Permanent Collection. However, sometimes some of those paintings aren't on view because they are either on loan to another museum or undergoing restoration, causing confusion and disappointment for some guests. To solve this problem, The Dali wanted to place icons over the paintings that weren't on view to indicate to visitors that these paintings were temporarily unavailable for viewing. The graphic design team created a plethora of options for both the "on loan" icon and the "restoration" icon. To the left is a mockup featuring some of the icons as they would appear on the app. The mockup was created in Photoshop and the icons were created in Illustrator. Below are some of the other icons that we produced. <br><br><img src="images/iconography2.png" width="70%"></p>

          <em>Year Created:</em> 2017<br><br>
            <em>Process:</em> I created this banner for use on <a href="https://shop.thedali.org/">The Dali's online store</a>. It was used for the duration of the exhibit (about five months), but has since been changed out for a banner featuring the current exhibit's products. The banner was used to advertise discounted items. Many of the design elements were provided to me. I discussed the layout with many members of The Dali team. <a href="images/download.gif">This GIF</a> shows how the banner was displayed on the Museum's website.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created this one-sheet as a prototype. It never made it past that phase while I was there, and I'm unsure if it was ever picked up after I left. It was created to be an easy handout which summarizes the information given in a ten-page impact report. I took all of the text from the original report, but placed my own emphasis on some key words. This one-sheet functions as a booklet which can be folded and read, then folded out completely as a mini-poster. We wanted to create a one-sheet which was economical and fully communicated all of the wonderful things accomplished at The Dali with the help of donors. I came up with the layout and most of the design on my own. I was handed the reigns on this project, and I really wish I had been able to stay long enough to see it come to fruition.</p>

I made extensive changes to the layout under the advice of <a href="https://www.juliahowarddesigns.com/">Julia Howard</a>, the Art Director at The Dali Museum. The treasure hunt went through several redesigns. It is currently available to any children (or adults!) at the audio tour desk at The Dali. It was challenging to make it available in nine different languages: Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. This presented unique challenges for the design. The version seen here was replaced shortly after it was printed, after I tweaked the design to better accommodate for the multiple languages to be used. The masthead, while it looks great, proved difficult to produce in nine different languages, so it was eventually changed into just a regular picture. A label for each language was placed just over the "riddle me this..." text, which was later adjusted. This treasure hunt was one of my biggest projects at The Dali. I was so excited and moved when I saw a young girl working on the treasure hunt while touring the Museum. </p>

            <em>Process:</em> I created these three inserts for a handful of table tents at The Museum's restaurant, Cafe Gala. The inserts advertise The Dali's new app, membership benefits, and The Dali's social media presence, respectively. I also created an insert to bring attention to The Dali's Sunday brunch. Initially, it was not used because the launch of the brunch was delayed, but it has since replaced the insert about the app. These table tents are still on view at The Dali. One of them made an appearance in a photo tweeted by the Dali Museum. I am also hidden in the photo on the social media insert—I'm the person in the middle!</p>

            <em>Process:</em> During a collateral overhaul and redesign, I created these two bookmark concept designs. These bookmarks would be given away to customers who made purchases in The Museum gift store. They are souvenirs so that people can fondly remember their time at The Dali, but also be encouraged to come back or make more purchases at the online store. These images show both the front and back of the bookmark. The back is the same on both. It provides information about membership benefits and advertises the online store. The first bookmark's front shows off a portion of Salvador Dali's 1960 painting <em>The Ecumenical Council</em>. This part of the painting shows a self-portrait of Dali painting a smaller canvas. The second bookmark has a very simple front which features only text. It quickly and easily conveys all the information a guest might need to contact or revisit the Museum.</p>

            <em>Process:</em> I collaborated with several members of The Dali team to create this advertisement for a map of St. Petersburg. Together we chose which pictures to feature, which copy to include, which quotes to use, and how to arrange the layout. Although we debated the red background, we ultimately decided that the red was eye-catching and would stick out on a map with several other ads. Unfortunately, this ad was not printed until after my internship ended, so I only have its digital form.</p>
